The Man-Machine is closer to the sound and style that would define early new wave electro-pop -- less minimalistic in its arrangements and more complex and danceable in its underlying rhythms. Like its predecessor, Trans-Europe Express, there is the feel of a divided concept album, with some songs devoted to science fiction-esque links between humans and technology, often with electronically processed vocals ("The Robots," "Spacelab," and the title track); others take the glamour of urbanization as their subject ("Neon Lights" and "Metropolis"). Plus, there's "The Model," a character sketch that falls under the latter category but takes a more cynical view of the title character's glamorous lifestyle. More pop-oriented than any of their previous work, the sound of The Man-Machine -- in particular among Kraftwerk's oeuvre -- had a tremendous impact on the cold, robotic synth pop of artists like Gary Numan, as well as Britain's later new romantic movement. Upon its release, the record charted at number 12 in Germany and 130 on the US Billboard 200. It originally only peaked at number 54 in the United Kingdom, but reached number 9 in 1982 after "The Model" became a number one single. The Man-Machine was voted at number 96 on Q magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Albums, and Pitchfork Media listed The Man-Machine as 92nd best album of the 1970s.
