A concept album exploring themes of broadcast communications, Radio-Activity marked Kraftwerk's return to more obtuse territory, extensively utilizing static, oscillators, and even Cage-like moments of silence to approximate the sense of radio transmission; a pivotal record in the group's continuing development, the title track -- the first they ever recorded in English -- is their most fully realized electro-pop effort to date, while "The Voice of Energy" precipitates the robot voice so crucial to their subsequent work. There are no flutes, guitars or any other kind of traditional instrument on Radio-Activity. Every link with their rock band past has been excised. Based around the twin themes of remote communication (radio-activity) and nuclear contamination (radioactivity), the tracks are diverse variations on a theme: "a sort of electronic chamber music", as their biographer Pascal Bussy puts it. There's a strong case for this being the first industrial album ever, and in 1975, that wasn't a bad thing. Kraftwerk were riding high on the crest of Autobahn, and to give them as much credit as is humanly possible, they didn't rest on the success of it, instead they pushed the boat out, in a way they never did before or since, crafting a synth pop album around the hectic life and times of work in a nuclear power plant.
