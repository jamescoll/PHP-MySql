This is a fan website for the German electronic band Kraftwerk written in HTML/Css and using PHP/MySql for the back-end. It additionally uses jQuery and Lightbox for the photo gallery feature.

It implements an mp3 player which works on a number of different browsers, styled tables which function as clickable playlists and a fairly straightforward but basic login system.

It was written on the Windows 7 platform using Notepad++ and phpmyadmin. 

This folder contains:

php files for each of the site pages		 	*.php
an export of the MySql database site backend 		database.sql
the css used to control the site layout 		css/
the images and media			media/		images/

And essentially everything you would need to recreate the site.

The site can be found at www.munnki.com/Web_Project/index.php
